        <p> Who is <strong>Ronnie</strong>?</p>
        
        <p>"Ronnie" is my nickname, and I've just started letting people call me that. I have other nicknames, such as; A-Aron, Nikky, and (I get called this more than Ronnie) Harvey. Since 5th Grade, I've played football, and other various sports. Such as; Basketball (I'm not as good), Soccer, Volleyball(my first sport), and I've attempted at Lacrosse. I'm a very caring person, that looks out for others and tries to make sure everybody is happy, and stable. I am a happy person, and whatever I do I want to spread happiness.</p>
