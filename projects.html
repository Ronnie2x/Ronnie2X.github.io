        Me, and my group are making a website that spreads awareness, support, and reaserch about aids. Yet, the project I will show is my personal narritive. It's long and you don't have to read it, but if you do, you'll get to see my conflict and resolution through my eyes. </p>

A couple of days after My grandmothers passing happened the whole house was gloomy. Nothing felt the same, an emptiness plagued the halls. I was 11 years old, and I should’ve thought: “I’m really sad”, or “I want her back”. Instead I adapted to the problem at hand, and I said to myself, “I can’t be sad like them, or we won’t move forward”. That was mature thinking for an 11 year old, who just lost somebody 11 days after their birthday, nonetheless; I just wanted home to feel like home again, and I knew God would help us to feel whole again.

My family felt like sheep in a flock that lost their Shepard. We were lost for days. After that, my mom & aunt turned on their clutch factor. My family didn’t want to fall in a deep depression, and be taken out of action. So, they turned up the notch to 100 all while being heartbroken. 

On the way back home, I was looking out the car window and saw a lone star. I showed my family, and that kind of gave us some light already. It felt like she was watching over us already, making sure we got home safe.

We wept for hours, days, week, months and to this date we still weep. Back then when everything first happened, I would wake up hoping everything was back to normal. Weeping through the halls always brought me back to reality. I just wanted things back normal, we all wanted that, but we knew it would never be the same; so we thought. 

When I went back to school, I felt like I didn’t know where to go. I went to the office, and cried to my counselor. I had to sat in his office, and waited for my sister to get there. We all had a good talk about how I felt, and how to carry on with school. Besides my family, he helped me get through, the school portion of my grandma’s passing.

After all of the trauma, I let my feelings out and cried, the relief was indescribable. I was always the one to console my family, because I felt like had to be the man. But, as I was building them up, I felt I was going down. That doesn’t mean my family didn’t care about me, because they regularly checked on me as well, but I felt this was my time to show I could handle manly duties. I hid my emotions in front of them so they could find joy in my smile. After I stopped hiding how I felt I learned that in manhood sharing your emotions with people that love you don’t make you weak. It’s a healing process for everyone and one cannot heal without the love and support of the ones around them. 

I was always told that I was funny, but I had to actually try. I think my grandma watching over me gives me more confidence about life. I tend to be more bold, outgoing, talkative, and assertive. Her passing made me see I’m capable of everything. My family was always like that though, but I was always the “bland” one. I’ve evolved, yet still have some of my bland ways.  Like my favorite flavor of ice cream is vanilla and I’ve tried foods from all over the world but I still love burgers and fries; little stuff like that.

While gaining the ability to be more talkative, I started to get more comfortable talking to people. When I say talking, I mean talking about a variety of different things. Such as: sports, business (networking night), feelings and my life goals. Recently, I’ve started to get comfortable with people being able to call me “Ronnie”, family nickname, because it’s a conversation builder. Now before, I wouldn’t even let people call me “A-A-Ron” but, I have gained that strength from my grandmother to break past being introverted and shy and these things are ok. 

Now, I don’t know if the person reading this is into religion, but WARNING. I’m going to be super honest, before my grandma passed, I didn’t believe in God. I never had an experience with Him. My family introduced me to religion but I didn’t understand it. I remember barely praying, yet the night when my grandma passed I prayed before I went to sleep. Ever since, I have been able to see and understand God’s Mercy. I pray every morning and night, I read a random bible verse, and I pray for my family and friends. 

While on the football field, I took one of the hardest hits I’ve ever taken. It made me think how I even started playing. One recess, I was just talking with friends, before we started playing football. I didn’t know what a curl was, yet that was the first route I ever ran. I dropped the ball, butterfingers. After that, it felt like my grandma gave me some sort of energy to try again. I ran a slant, and caught my defender off guard and scored. I’ve never felt so joyous in my life, I wanted the ball every time, it was a rush. It was the first time I really felt like I was “that guy”. 

God, my family, football and make my life joyful and whole. Whenever God puts an obstacle in front of you it isn’t to break your faith it’s meant to build it. You have to lean on a higher force than yourself to see beyond yourself. Coming from a spiritual family and building my own spiritual connection has greatly helped every part of my life. I’m grateful and happy for the amazing times and the challenges life has given me, but I’m even more grateful that God is allowing my grandmother to stick by my side as I go through all of them. </p>
